Welcome to my site! I'll use this space to show projects I've worked on and talk about things I find interesting.

## About Me

I am a first-year MS Computer Science student at University of California, San Diego. Before that, I got my BS in Computer Science from Rochester Institute of Technology. I've also done several internships at Oracle, Microsoft, and Pixar Animation Studios.

My primary interests are computer graphics and high-performance computing. Check out some of my projects like my [GPU rendering engine](https://github.com/abau171/dino/) or my [distributed Rubik's Cube solver](https://github.com/abau171/cubetree/).

```
#include "GL/glew.h"
#include "GL/glut.h"
#include "cuda_runtime.h"
#include "device_launch_parameters.h"
#include "curand.h"
#include "curand_kernel.h"
#include "cuda_gl_interop.h"

int main() {
    std::cout << "test\n";
}
```
