# Hi there!

My name is Andrew Bauer, and I'm a Computer Science student at UC San Diego. My primary interests are in physically-based rendering and GPU programming. I've done several internships at companies such as Microsoft, Pixar, and Disney Animation Studios.

I earned my BS in Computer Science from Rochester Institute of Technology, and I'm working on my MS in Computer Science at UC San Diego. My advisor is [Ravi Ramamoorthi](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/), and my research interests include path guiding and interactive path tracing on GPU.
