description: GPU-based path tracer designed for highly interactive rendering. Includes a progressive rendering mode which allows on-the-fly modification of most scene data including camera, lighting, object models, material properties, and integrator settings.

Dino is a personal renderer project which runs entirely on GPU. I use Dino to test rendering techniques with a focus on keeping things as interactive as possible. Dino is written in C++, uses OptiX 7 for ray traversal and OpenGL for the interactive veiwer.
