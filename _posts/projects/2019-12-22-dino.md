description: GPU-based path tracer designed for highly interactive rendering. Includes a progressive rendering mode which allows on-the-fly modification of most scene data including camera, lighting, object models, material properties, and integrator settings.

Dino is a personal renderer project which runs entirely on GPU. I use Dino to experiment with rendering techniques with a focus on keeping things as interactive as possible.

{% include gfycat.html tag="whimsicalexaltedeastrussiancoursinghounds" type="big" %}

Dino is written in C++, and uses OptiX 7 for ray tracing, CUDA for miscellaneous GPU processing, and OpenGL for the interactive viewer.

## Features

- interactive, progressive rendering in OpenGL window
- Mitsuba-style `eval()`/`sample()`/`pdf()` interface
- texture mapping for arbitrary BSDF channels
- multiple supported integrators (path tracing and light tracing)
- next event estimation
- multiple importance sampling for direct lighting
- Russian roulette
- Beer's law attenuation
- depth of field
- HDR environment maps
- model instancing
- Phong surface normal interpolation
- JSON scene files
- Wavefront .obj model loading

Dino is under active development! Keep an eye on [my blog](/blog) for updates.
